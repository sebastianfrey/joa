# JOA - Java OGC API (Work In Progress)

An OGC API implementation built with Dropwizard.

## About

JOA follows a minimialistic aproach, which allows **Zero Config** deployment of an **OGC API**.

Currently the following backends are supported:

- [GeoPackage](https://www.geopackage.org/) powerd by [NGA's GeoPackage Java lib](https://github.com/ngageoint/geopackage-java) (`Default`)

Which conforms to the following standards:

- [OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html)

## Getting started

This section demonstrates, how JOA can be deployed using the GeoPackage backend using docker.

TODO

Then open your browser, go to http://localhost:8080/api/ and enjoy your **Zero Config** OGC API. =)
